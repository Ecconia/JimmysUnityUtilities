# Jimmy's Unity Utilities
This repository contains a bunch of code that I like to have on hand when working in Unity. Included is:

* `Color24` struct, which is like Unity's `Color32` but without a transparency byte
* `ScriptableObjectSingleton<T>` struct, for creating scriptable object singletons
* `ObjectPoolUtility<T>` class, for creating object pools
* `FileUtilities` class, with helpful functions for working with the file system
* `CoroutineUtility` class, for running coroutines
* a crapload of extension methods both for Unity types and C# types
